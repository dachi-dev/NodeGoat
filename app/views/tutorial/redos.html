                The Regular expression Denial of Service (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">ReDoS</a>) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.

                    When untrusted data input is executed on an a regex pattern, it may exploit vulnerable patterns into
                    running long calculations to match for a given string. For Node.js this is extremely important due to
                    the single-threaded event-loop architecture which means that the main Node.js process is blocked from
                    serving any other requests.

                        Avoid writing your own regular expressions

                        Use Node.js's <a href="https://github.com/chriso/validator.js/">validator.js</a> package to
                        validate expected data format instead of writing your own regular expressions

                    <li>
                        As a last resort of writing your own regex patterns you can utilize Node.js's
                        <a href="https://github.com/substack/safe-regex">safe-regex</a> package which allows detecting
                        if a regex is prone to catastrophic backtracking, and also allows to configure threshold for
                        maximum repetitions.
